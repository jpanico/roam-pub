    """Fetch Roam nodes for *fetch_spec* and build a validated node tree and vertex tree.

    Fetches :class:`~roam_pub.roam_node.RoamNode` records for *fetch_spec* via
    *api_endpoint*, constructs a :class:`~roam_pub.roam_tree.NodeTree`, and optionally
    transcribes it to a :class:`~roam_pub.graph.VertexTree`.

    Exits the CLI with code 1 when the fetch raises an exception or when no nodes are found.

    Args:
        fetch_spec: The fetch specification carrying the anchor, include_refs flag, and
            include_node_tree flag.
        include_vertex_tree: When ``True``, transcribes the node tree to a
            :class:`~roam_pub.graph.VertexTree` and returns it as the second element of
            the pair.  When ``False``, skips transcription and returns ``None`` instead.
        api_endpoint: Configured API endpoint used to fetch nodes.

    Returns:
        A ``(fetch_result, vertex_tree)`` pair ready for rendering or further processing.
        ``vertex_tree`` is ``None`` when *include_vertex_tree* is ``False``.
