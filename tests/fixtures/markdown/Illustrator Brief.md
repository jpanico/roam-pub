# Illustrator Brief — *Source Code For Humans*

## Overview
- **purpose**: Educational book
- **book title**: *Source Code for Humans*
- **book subtitle**: *Cognitive Ergonomics of Computer Programming*
- **illustration deliverables**: 
  - count: **approx. 10** illustrations-- 1 front Cover + 9 chapter/section illustrations [^CHAPILL]
  - for details, see the [Deliverables section](#deliverables)
- **illustration tone/mood/vibe**: 
  - illustrations are **non-technical** -- they are meant to convey a mood/feeling, not to convey technical information.
  - man vs. machine. Will society ensure that all software is written, whether by humans or AIs, to keep humans firmly in control? Or will societies resign themselves to a world where software is an inscrutable black-box-- given to becoming a Pandora's box?
- **book tone**: 
  - whether written by humans or by AIs, computer programming source code is inherently difficult for humans to understand, because of its formal, strictly logical, nature. Even so, source code can be written in a way that maximizes human comprehension (at least for experienced programmers). But this doesn't happen by accident or by default-- it requires a tremendous amount of dilligence, and skill, on the part of the author. Most importantly, it requires that the author, whether human or AI, prioritizes human comprehension (human needs) over just "getting it done" (the needs of the machine). Without prioritizing the needs of humans, societies will be left critically (life or death) reliant on source code that we cannot understand. Surely, that would be a dystopian future.
- **publication route**: 
  - initially: self-published. This provides the highest royalty rate (50-70%), and the lowest barriers to entry. Self-publication platform will probably be Amazon Kindle Direct Publish ([KDP](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G202172740)), [IngramSpark](https://www.ingramspark.com/), [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/), or [Blurb](https://www.blurb.com/self-publish). 
  - eventually: if self-publication is successful (sales > 10K/year), the book is likely to attract commercial publishing houses. If the traditional publishers can offer decent royalty rates (> 40%), then will consider going in that direction.
- **publication language**: English 1st (possibly followed by other languages later)
- **publication formats**: softcover, e-book, hardcover 
- **target book length**: approx. 250 pages
- **target publication date**: Dec. 2026

## Target Audience
- programmers, with at least a rudimentary understanding of computer programming, in **any** programming language (addressable audience: ~40 million worldwide).
- *Software Engineering Managers* (addressable audience: ~5 million worldwide).

## Style Direction
- illustrations are **non-technical** -- they are meant to convey a mood/feeling, not to convey technical information.
- the illustrations should give the viewer a feeling of: **Man vs. Machine**. That society and civilization face a choice between the needs of humans vs. the needs of the machines.
- each illustration should make the viewer feel the differences between humans and machines:
	- humans:
		- alive: organic, breathing, warm, eating, growing, moving, reproducing
		- emotional: animalistic, inconsistent, not naturally logical, sensitive
		- Irregularly shaped: highly asymmetric
	- machines:
		- inanimate: inorganic, mechanical, cold, still, consuming electricity 
		- unemotional: 
		- regular, uniform, geometry
		- purely logical
		- insensitive
- illustrations should make the viewer feel the tensions, conflicts, inconsistencies, between the needs of humans and the needs of the machines.
- a consistent design language should be used across all illustrations.
- within each illustration, the illustrator can use fundamentally different design/artistic techniques/approaches for the human elements versus those for the machines. In other words, the illustrator can use discontinuous, or disjoint, techniques/styles (e.g. multi-media) within the same illustration, as a way of accentuating the differences and tensions between the two.
- original illustrations **must** be done using traditional studio art methods: painting (acrylic, oil, watercolor); drawing (graphite, charcoal, conte, ink, pastel); sculpture. Use of traditional media, as opposed to digital tools, is very important-- in order to convey the **primacy** of humans over the machines (computers).
- no modern natural languages (e.g. English) or computer source code should appear within the illustrations
	- the illustrator can include, at their discretion, extinct languages (hieroglyphics), pictograms, or synthetic pictorial language of their choosing.
- it is possible that a substantial portion (10-25%) of the audience will read the book on black and white, or grayscale, e-book readers (e.g. Kindle). So particular attention must be paid to the final reproduction of the originally color artwork for these devices.

## Deliverables
- count: **approx. 10** illustrations-- 1 front Cover + 9 chapter/section illustrations [^CHAPILL].

## **Book Story**
- There is currently an epic war under way for the heart and soul of computer programming:
	- on one side are the **humans** ...
		- Who own and maintain the programming source code. They are accountable for __fully **understanding**__ how the computer program works. All liability for the outcomes of running the program rests on the owner/maintainer. At risk are: their jobs; the reputations of the companies they work for; in many cases, large sums of money; and increasingly, lives (e.g. air-traffic/public-transit control software, medical instrument and record-keeping software, weapons control software, etc.). 
		- It is common in modern software engineering practice that those who currently own/maintain a computer program did not themselves write all, or even much, of the underlying source code that comprises it. Instead, some or all of the source code was authored by: other team members; former members of the organization they work for; open source developers whose work has been integrated into the program; and increasingly, AIs.
		- Software owners/maintainers are limited in their ability to faithfully meet all of their obligations by how well, and how quickly, they can fully understand the portfolio of source code that is under their care. For complex systems, which encompass most modern software of commercial/societal value, understanding a codebase can be a very daunting endeavor-- even for highly skilled programmers. Because programming code is written in *formal languages* (i.e. programming languages), which have precise, technical, and __unnatural__, forms and meanings, it can be quite difficult for readers of source code to glean the intent of the original authors. Without a complete understanding of a complex codebase, it is very arduous and risky for a programmer to support/modify/extend/enhance the code. Depending on the context, small mistakes could result in catastrophic outcomes.
		- (consider providing examples of some great software disasters for context/inspiration)
	- on the other side are the **machines** ...
		- Machines, in the form of computers, are responsible for executing, and more recently writing (AIs), the source code that is owned and maintained by humans. These machines do not __understand__ the source code— that's not their job. They have no comprehension of the intent or goals of computer programs, and no appreciation at all for the risks (human costs) associated with failures. They do a flawless job of mechanically, emotionlessly, executing the formal, explicit, instructions that are encoded in computer programs. Whether or not those formal instructions are properly aligned with the goals and values of the humans who own them, the computers will execute them with equal diligence, oblivious to the difference.
		- Machines have no responsibility for the software that they execute or write. Modern legal systems, that form the basis for society, do not recognize machines (AIs) as legal entities. Legal liability falls entirely on the humans who oversee these machines. 
		- AIs have no __innate__ ability to recognize what is or is not intelligible to humans. Without explicit guidance from humans, they will write source code that works, but is utterly incomprehensible to humans. They will modify source code written by humans, in ways that are completely inconsistent with the ways that the human authors designed, and think about, the code-- but the program will still work. 
	- Human comprehensibility of source code does not happen by default. Without a tremendous amount of thought, care, and craft, both human and AI programmers will write code that is somewhere between difficult to understand and utterly impenetrable. And today, the software industry is experiencing a crisis of comprehensibility and maintainability. The humans and organizations who own and maintain computer programs operate in a extremely stressful, high-risk, environment because of the ordeal of trying to fully grasp a codebase that does not prioritize clarity for humans.
	- The stakeholders in computer programs have to decide who the source code will be primarily written for: humans or machines. Will they make the needed investments, in time and care, to prioritize human comprehensibility? Or will human comprehension be an afterthought, and only the needs of the machines (computers/AIs) take primacy-- with all of the liabilities, both societal and personal, that entails?
	- **This book is all about 2 ideas:**
		- **Why** source code, whether written **by** humans or AIs, must be written **for** humans 1st-- with human comprehensibility as the highest goal. Or, coming at it from the other side, the dire consequences if source code is written **for** only the needs of the machines.
		- **How** source code can be written to maximize intelligibility to humans. What are: the basic principles, the elements, the guidelines, the practices.

[^ICT6]: At Apple, **ICT6** stands for **Individual Contributor Technical Level 6**. It is an elite, high-ranking role typically referred to as **Principal Engineer** or, in some organizations, **Distinguished Engineer**. Within Apple's notoriously flat and secretive hierarchy, this is considered one of the "pinnacle" technical positions for someone who wants to remain an individual contributor (IC) rather than moving into people management.

[^CHAPILL]: A chapter illustration is a small piece of artwork that appears on the chapter’s opening page—to visually introduce or enrich that section of the story. It can be a decorative motif, a vignette related to the events of that chapter, or a more detailed scene featuring characters or setting, but it is not meant to replace the text and is usually used sparingly. Chapter illustrations help set the mood or tone before the reader dives into the new section, sometimes hinting at key objects, locations, or emotions that will appear in that chapter.
