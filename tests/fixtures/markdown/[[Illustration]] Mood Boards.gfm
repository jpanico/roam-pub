## Incomprehensible source code is ***dangerous***/***threatening*** to humans (but computers/AIs don't care)

### The Toyota "Unintended Acceleration" Case (2005–2010) – 89 deaths

This is perhaps the most famous modern example of "spaghetti code"
having lethal consequences. After a series of crashes involving Toyota
vehicles accelerating uncontrollably, NASA and software experts (Barr
Group) audited the source code for the Electronic Throttle Control
System (ETCS).

**The State of the Code:** Experts found over **10,000 global
variables** (data points that can be changed from anywhere in the
program). The code violated almost every standard for safety-critical
systems. It had a "Cyclomatic Complexity" score (a measure of how many
paths code can take) that was off the charts—literally un-testable.

**The Disaster:** Because the code was a "spaghetti" mess, it suffered
from stack overflows and memory corruption that would kill the
"failsafe" task. When the failsafe died, the engine would lock into a
wide-open throttle state.

**The Fallout:** Toyota recalled millions of vehicles and paid over
**\$1.2 billion** in a DOJ settlement.

### Therac-25 Radiation Overdoses (1985-1987) – 3 deaths, 3 maimings

This is perhaps the most tragic example of "spaghetti code" and a lack
of fundamental understanding of source code. The Therac-25 radiation
therapy machine gave patients radiation doses hundreds of times greater
than normal due to concurrent programming errors (race conditions),
killing at least three people and seriously injuring three others.

**The Root Cause:** The Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine.
Unlike its predecessors, it relied almost entirely on software for
safety interlocks rather than hardware.

**The Lack of Understanding:** The software was largely reused from
older models (Therac-6 and Therac-20). The developers didn't realize
that the older code had bugs that were previously "masked" by hardware
safety switches. When moved to a software-only environment, a subtle
"race condition" occurred.

**The Catastrophe:** If an operator typed commands too quickly, the
software would fail to set the machine's physical shield in place but
still fire a high-intensity beam. Several patients received lethal doses
of radiation because the programmers didn't understand the timing
nuances of their own inherited code.

### Knight Capital Trading Disaster (2012) – \$440 Million in 45 Minutes

An old, dormant piece of code was accidentally reactivated during a
software deployment. The incomprehensible legacy code began executing
unintended trades at a massive scale, causing Knight Capital to lose
\$440 million in just 45 minutes and nearly bankrupting the company.

**The Root Cause:** The firm deployed new software to servers, but one
server was accidentally left running a dormant, decade-old piece of code
called "Power Peg."

**The Lack of Understanding:** The current engineering team didn't
realize this old code still existed or how it functioned. When the new
system triggered a specific flag, the "zombie" code woke up and began
buying millions of shares at high prices and selling them low.

**The Catastrophe:** Because no one understood how the old code
interacted with the new deployment, they couldn't stop it in time. They
eventually had to shut down the entire system to kill the process.

### UK Post Office Horizon Scandal (2000-2020) – 736 False Convictions

The UK Post Office Horizon scandal is often cited as one of the most
widespread miscarriages of justice in British history. While the scandal
involved institutional cover-ups and legal failures, **source code
incomprehensibility** and systemic software bugs were the technical
engines of the disaster.

### The "Black Box" Fallacy in Court

The central legal issue was a presumption in English law that "computers
are reliable unless proven otherwise." Because the Horizon source code
was a proprietary, multimillion-line "black box" owned by Fujitsu,
sub-postmasters had no way to inspect it.

**Incomprehensibility as a Shield:** When postmasters reported "phantom
shortfalls" (money missing from accounts that they hadn't taken), the
Post Office and Fujitsu claimed the system was "robust."

**The Burden of Proof:** Because the code was too complex for a
layperson (or even a general IT expert) to audit without full access,
defendants could not prove the existence of bugs. They were essentially
told, "The computer says you stole money, and we can't see anything
wrong with the computer."

### Specific Technical Failures

When the source code was eventually audited during the 2019 High Court
case (*Bates v Post Office*), several critical flaws were found that had
been hidden by the system's complexity

The incomprehensibility of the code meant that even when Fujitsu
engineers found bugs (which they did as early as 1999), the complexity
of the legacy system made them hesitant to admit how deep the rot went.
It was easier to blame "human error" than to untangle a "spaghetti code"
mess that governed thousands of branches.

**Spaghetti Code** made it nearly impossible for independent experts to
find bugs quickly.

### *A Fire Upon the Deep* by Vernor Vinge (Fiction) – entire star systems consumed by computer virus

This is the definitive "programmer archaeology" novel. Vinge (who was a
computer science professor) imagines a future where software is
thousands of years old.

**The Catastrophe:** An ancient, dormant super-intelligence (The Blight)
is "woken up" by researchers poking around in a 5-billion-year-old data
archive. Because the researchers don't understand the "spaghetti code"
of the archive, they accidentally unleash a virus that consumes entire
star systems.

**The Concept:** Software is rarely written from scratch; instead, it is
built on top of "legacy code" from thousands of years prior. Engineers
are called "Archaeoprogrammers" because their job is to dig through
layers of incomprehensible, ancient operating systems to find functions.
